void

The (nonexistent) value of a void expression (an expression that has type void) shall not be used in any way, 
and implicit or explicit conversions (except to void) shall not be applied to such an expression. If an expression 
of any other type is evaluated as a void expression, its value or designator is discarded. (A void expression is 
evaluated for its side effects.)

void;
